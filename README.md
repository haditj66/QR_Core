# What is AEROS?
  - This is a small ecosystem of code generation tools to create ROS2 projects in c++. There are patterns
  and tools built in to help quick prototyping. This is done through cmake and cgenMin, a dotnet application handling a 
  bulk of the code generation. In addition to code generation, QR_core holds code needed for the implementations
  of the patterns used here.
