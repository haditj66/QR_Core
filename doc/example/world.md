## Overview 
This example is a small world that is comprised of a 2 dimensional grid. gameobjects of different kind can occupy the grid or world. gameobjects can move around the grid
and interact with other gameobjects. This is a simple application outlining the features of Resource sharing, Aynchronus non-blocking code, and real time events that are common within ROS2. 
The AO used in this project are 
-world2(Surrogate AO): a server-like AO that is resposible for moving the objects around the grid.
-gameobject(Surrogate AO): can be of any type from creatures to static objects like a rock.
